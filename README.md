Solution Structure:

The solution is built using the Flask framework and follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Here is an overview of the structure:

Routes:
"/" (home): Renders the base.html template, which serves as the base layout for other pages.
"/listmembers": Retrieves a list of members from the database and renders the memberlist.html template, passing the member list data.
"/listevents": Retrieves a list of events from the database and renders the eventlist.html template, passing the event list data.
"/member/": Takes a member ID as a parameter, performs a database query to fetch member details, and renders the memberdetails.html template, passing the member details data.
"/admin": Renders the admin.html template, which provides an interface for administrative tasks.
"/admin_search": Handles a GET request, retrieves search parameters from the query string, performs a database search based on the provided parameters, and renders the admin_search.html template, passing the search results data.
"/add_member": Handles both GET and POST requests. If it receives a POST request, it retrieves form data, performs an INSERT operation in the members table of the database, and returns a success message. If it receives a GET request, it renders the add_member.html template, providing a form to add a new member.
"/add_event": Handles both GET and POST requests similar to "/add_member" but for adding events.
"/event_stage": Handles both GET and POST requests similar to "/add_member" but for adding event stages.
"/add_scores": Handles a POST request to add scores to the database.
"/reports": Renders the reports.html template, passing data related to gold, silver, and bronze counts, as well as a grouped list of winners.
Templates:
base.html: Serves as the base layout for other templates, providing a common structure for the application.
memberlist.html: Displays a list of members fetched from the database.
eventlist.html: Displays a list of events fetched from the database.
memberdetails.html: Displays detailed information about a specific member, including their event participation and scores.
admin.html: Provides an interface for administrative tasks, such as searching for members and events.
admin_search.html: Displays search results based on the provided parameters.
add_member.html: Provides a form to add a new member.
add_event.html: Provides a form to add a new event.
add_event_stage.html: Provides a form to add a new event stage.
reports.html: Displays reports related to gold, silver, and bronze counts, as well as a grouped list of winners.
Assumptions and Design Decisions:

Assumptions:
The application assumes the existence of a MySQL database with specific tables (members, teams, events, event_stage, event_stage_results) and their defined structures.
The database connection details (host, user, password, database) are stored in a separate "connect.py" file.
The application assumes that the database connection is established using the provided credentials before any database operations.
The application assumes the availability of the required MySQL connector library.
Design Decisions:
The application uses separate templates for different pages to maintain separation of concerns and improve code organization.
The routes handle different functionalities such as rendering templates, performing database queries, and handling form submissions.
GET and POST methods are distinguished within the routes to handle different types of requests
